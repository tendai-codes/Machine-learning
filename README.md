# Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository showcases a series of machine learning projects tackling various real-world problems through regression, classification, and clustering models. Each project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and analysis to provide actionable insights and predictions.

### Projects Overview:

1. **Startup Profit Prediction (Regression)**  
   Built a multiple linear regression model to predict the profitability of startups, providing actionable insights to a venture capital firm for portfolio expansion decisions.

2. **Salary Compensation Strategy Optimization (Regression)**  
   Developed multiple regression models using webscraped data to assist HR departments in optimizing salary strategies within the management consulting industry.

3. **Breast Cancer Prediction (Classification)**  
   Implemented various classification models to predict the development of breast cancer in women using information retrieved from tissue biopsy.

4. **Customer Segmentation for Marketing Strategies (Clustering)**  
   Applied K-Means and hierarchical clustering techniques to segment customers based on spending and income, aiding in the development of targeted marketing strategies.
   
5. **Bank Customer Segmentation Analysis (K-Means & Principal Component Analysis)**
   Analyzed bank customer data to segment customers using K-Means Clustering, with dimensionality reduction achieved through PCA. This approach resulted in 7 well-defined customer segments based on key financial behaviors, optimizing the bank's ability to tailor products and services.
  
7. **Ridge Regression Model (Python & TensorFlow)**
   Built a ridge regression model to predict stock prices with high accuracy. Leveraged Pandas for data preprocessing, and TensorFlow for model development. Achieved an R-squared score of 98%, with a k-fold cross-validation score of 86%.

8.  **Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network**
   Developed an LSTM neural network to predict stock price trends using a recurrent neural network structure. Preprocessed data using Pandas and constructed the model in TensorFlow. The model achieved an average validation loss of 0.000117 using k-fold cross-validation.
